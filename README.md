# My FrontLoops

This is a repo I created to track my progress and holds my solution for the [frontloops](https://frontloops.io/) tasks.

## Note

- All solutions must work with Chrome, Firefox, EDGE and Safari, last 2 versions should be fine.
- The prefix, if necessary, must be added **manually**.

- Use `float` to display the layout because the items have different height.
